Authorization*
string
Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is obtained via either a two-legged or three-legged OAuth flow.

URI Parameters
accountId
string: UUID
The ID of the ACC account that contains the project being created or the projects being retrieved. This corresponds to the hub ID in the Data Management API. To convert a hub ID into an account ID, remove the “b." prefix. For example, a hub ID of b.c8b0c73d-3ae9 translates to an account ID of c8b0c73d-3ae9.

orFilters
array: string
List of filtered fields to apply an “or” operator. Valid list of fields are erpId, name, taxId, trade, updatedAt.

Valid fields for sorting are name, trade, erpId, taxId, status, createdAt, updatedAt, projectSize and userSize. Default sort is name.

projects/:project_id/users
GET	projects/{projectId}/users
Retrieves information about a filtered subset of users in the specified project.

There are two primary reasons to do this:

To verify that all users assigned to the project have been activated as members of the project.
To check other information about users, such as their project user ID, roles, and products.
Note that if you want to retrieve information about users associated with a particular Autodesk account, call the GET users endpoint.

Note that this endpoint is compatible with both BIM 360 and Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) projects.

projectId
string: UUID
The ID of the project. This corresponds to project ID in the Data Management API. To convert a project ID in the Data Management API into a project ID in the ACC API you need to remove the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7.

Query String Parameters
filter[products]
array: string
A comma-separated list of the products that the returned users must have access to in the specified project. Only users that have access to one or more of the specified products are returned.

Some products are exclusive to ACC or to BIM 360, others are available on both platforms. Specify only the products on the appropriate platform for the users you want to retrieve.

Possible ACC values: accountAdministration, autoSpecs, build, buildingConnected, capitalPlanning, cloudWorksharing, cost, designCollaboration, docs, financials, insight, modelCoordination, projectAdministration, takeoff, and workshopxr.

Possible BIM 360 values: accountAdministration, assets, cloudWorksharing, costManagement, designCollaboration, documentManagement, field, fieldManagement, glue, insight, modelCoordination, plan, projectAdministration, projectHome, projectManagement, and quantification.
